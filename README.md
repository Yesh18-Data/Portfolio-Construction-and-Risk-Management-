# Portfolio Construction and Risk Management Project

This repository contains the code and documentation for the Portfolio Construction and Risk Management  project. The project leverages Python libraries to perform comprehensive analysis and Risk management of investment portfolios.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the comprehensive analysis and Risk management of investment portfolios using historical stock data. The primary tasks performed include data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

## Libraries Used

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **Numpy**: For numerical operations
- **Yfinance**: For fetching historical market data
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization

## Key Features
- **Data Collection**: Utilized `yfinance` to fetch historical stock prices and other relevant financial data.
- **Data Cleaning**: Processed and cleaned the data using `pandas` to ensure consistency and accuracy.
- **Visualization**: Created various plots using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to visualize the data and analysis results.
- **Portfolio Construction**: Built a diversified investment portfolio using selected assets.
- **Value at Risk (VaR)**: Calculated the potential loss in the portfolio's value over a defined period for a given confidence interval.
- **Asset Allocation**: Determined the optimal distribution of assets in the portfolio to balance risk and return.
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Applied optimization techniques to determine the optimal asset allocation for maximizing returns and minimizing risk.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the raw and cleaned datasets used in the analysis.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks detailing the step-by-step analysis and visualization.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- `results/`: Output files and visualizations generated from the analysis.
